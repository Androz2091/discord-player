## Setup your development environment

To get started with Discord Player, you need to have a few things set up on your local machine.

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Discord Player is built on Node.js, so you need to have it installed on your machine.
-   [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm): NPM is the package manager for Node.js. You will need it to install Discord Player and its dependencies.
-   Optionally [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download): To get the best out of Discord Player, we recommend you use TypeScript, but it's not required.

### Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i discord-player @discord-player/extractor mediaplex
```

```bash yarn
yarn add discord-player @discord-player/extractor mediaplex
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add discord-player @discord-player/extractor mediaplex
```

```bash bun
bun add discord-player @discord-player/extractor mediaplex
```

</CodeGroup>

Here's what each package does:

-   `discord-player`: The core package for Discord Player.
-   `@discord-player/extractor`: A collection of audio/metadata extractors for Discord Player.
-   `mediaplex`: Efficient alternative to `@discordjs/opus` and a library that provides various media utilities.

<Note>
    If you are unable to install mediaplex on your system, you can install one of `@discordjs/opus`, `opusscript`,
    `@evan/opus` or `node-opus`.
</Note>

### Creating your first bot

To create your first bot, check out the [discord.js guidebook](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html).

### Adding Discord Player to your bot

Once you have your bot set up, you can add Discord Player to your bot by following the steps below:

#### 1. Import the `discord-player` package in your bot's main file.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
import { Player } from 'discord-player';
```

```js ES Modules
import { Player } from 'discord-player';
```

```js CommonJS
const { Player } = require('discord-player');
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 2. Create a new instance of the `Player` class.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
const client = new Client({
    /* client options */
    intents: ['GuildVoiceStates' /* other intents */],
});

const player = new Player(client);
```

```js ES Modules
const client = new Client({
    /* client options */
    intents: ['GuildVoiceStates' /* other intents */],
});

const player = new Player(client);
```

```js CommonJS
const client = new Client({
    /* client options */
    intents: ['GuildVoiceStates' /* other intents */],
});

const player = new Player(client);
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>The `Client` class is provided by discord.js</Note>

<Info>
    **Good to know:** You don't need to add `client.player = ...`. Discord Player exposes various type-safe hooks to get
    around this situation.
</Info>

#### 3. Register some extractors to the player.

Discord Player by default cannot play audio or pull metadata. These extractors help Discord Player to fetch audio and metadata from various sources.

<Info>
    **Good to know:** Discord Player itself is not responsible for tos-violations/similar issues. The streaming behavior
    is entirely dependent on the extractors you load, thus making it your responsibility to ensure that you are not
    using any extractor that violates the terms of service of the respective platform.
</Info>

#### 4. Listen to the `playerStart` event

This event is emitted whenever Discord Player starts to play a track. You can use this event to notify the user when a track starts playing.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
import type { GuildQueue } from 'discord-player';
import type { TextBasedChannel } from 'discord.js';

interface Metadata {
    channel: TextBasedChannel;
}

player.events.on('playerStart', (queue: GuildQueue<Metadata>, track) => {
    queue.metadata.channel.send(`Started playing **${track.title}**!`);
});
```

```js ES Modules
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => {
    queue.metadata.channel.send(`Started playing **${track.title}**!`);
});
```

```js CommonJS
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => {
    queue.metadata.channel.send(`Started playing **${track.title}**!`);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 5. Add a command to play the track.

This code shall be inside your command file. `useMainPlayer` is a hook provided by Discord Player to get the main player instance. This hook is type-safe and can be used in both TypeScript and JavaScript.

In this example, it is assumed that you have a command setup with a `query` option. Please refer to the [discord.js guidebook](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands.html) to learn how to create commands with options.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
import { useMainPlayer } from 'discord-player';

export async function execute(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    const player = useMainPlayer();
    // 1: Get query
    const query = interactions.options.getString('query', true);
    // 2: Get voice channel
    const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channel;

    await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true });

    if (!voiceChannel) {
        return interaction.editReply('You are not connected to a voice channel!');
    }

    const queueMetadata = {
        channel: interaction.channel,
    };

    try {
        // 3: Play the track
        const { track } = await player.play(voiceChannel, query, {
            nodeOptions: {
                metadata: queueMetadata,
            },
        });

        return interaction.editReply(`Started playing **${track.title}** in ${voiceChannel}.`);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return interaction.editReply('Failed to play the track due to an error.');
    }
}
```

```js ES Modules
import { useMainPlayer } from 'discord-player';

export async function execute(interaction) {
    const player = useMainPlayer();
    // 1: Get query
    const query = interactions.options.getString('query', true);
    // 2: Get voice channel
    const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channel;

    await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true });

    if (!voiceChannel) {
        return interaction.editReply('You are not connected to a voice channel!');
    }

    const queueMetadata = {
        channel: interaction.channel,
    };

    try {
        // 3: Play the track
        const { track } = await player.play(voiceChannel, query, {
            nodeOptions: {
                metadata: queueMetadata,
            },
        });

        return interaction.editReply(`Started playing **${track.title}** in ${voiceChannel}.`);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return interaction.editReply('Failed to play the track due to an error.');
    }
}
```

```js CommonJS
const { useMainPlayer } = require('discord-player');

export async function execute(interaction) {
    const player = useMainPlayer();

    // 1: Get query
    const query = interactions.options.getString('query', true);
    // 2: Get voice channel
    const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channel;

    await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true });

    if (!voiceChannel) {
        return interaction.editReply('You are not connected to a voice channel!');
    }

    const queueMetadata = {
        channel: interaction.channel,
    };

    try {
        // 3: Play the track
        const { track } = await player.play(voiceChannel, query, {
            nodeOptions: {
                metadata: queueMetadata,
            },
        });

        return interaction.editReply(`Started playing **${track.title}** in ${voiceChannel}.`);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return interaction.editReply('Failed to play the track due to an error.');
    }
}
```

That's it! You have successfully set up Discord Player in your bot. You can now start playing music in your Discord server.
